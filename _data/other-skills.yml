  desc: I always wanted to share my learnings and explain difficult concepts as efficiently as possible. 
        And that is when I got the push I required, Technical Writer position at The Research Nest. 
        The beauty of writing is the clarity of the concepts it provides. 
        And I continue to write with the same incentive.

  desc: Contributing to the Student Branch and being an executive member of IEEE, helped me evolve. 
        Not just as a professional but as a human being. 
        When you need to manage 100 student volunteers and lead them towards the same goal, 
        it enhances your growth more than any big project.

  desc: I took up teaching for one sole purpose, to contribute back. I wanted to show the students that 
        AI is not that difficult if you understand it right. I wanted to explain to them the basics well, 
        and help them not make the same mistakes I did. So that they could go even further than what I am right now.
        For that reason, I started the AIC in February 2019, as soon as I became the Secretary of the SB. Do visit
        AIC section for more on that.
