  <h1 id="about-me"><strong>Artificial Intelligence Club</strong></h1>

<p>Welcome!</p>
I am the founder of the <strong>Artifical Intelligence Club</strong> for the IEEE GCET SB. My vision for the club is to make a community for the young enthusiasts
in the field of Artificial Intelligence and to provide them a platform where they can learn, share and create
anything related to this amazing field of Artificial Intelligence. AIC commenced in February 2019. We changed the policy
and the workings of AIC in March 2020.</p>

      <h3 class="card-title">Functioning</h3>
      <p class="card-text">We keep different tracks of learning. For each field in AI, we keep a seperate track.
        The ongoing tracks are: Machine Learning Basics, Python Fundamentals and Data Science. We also keep focused groups.
        Research Paper Readings is one of them. We conduct weekly meetings to discuss various questions about the topic and to get an update on different tracks.

      <p class="card-text">With the new workings of AIC, we added some of the essential needs of a student in their academia.
        Due to the lack of guidance, students, although enthusiatic and skilled, are not able to showcase or implement their 
        talent into things like projects or research. We provide one-to-one mentoring to students for any of their projects.

Listen from some of the current and former members of <strong>Artifical Intelligence Club</strong>. 
See how the workings of AIC aligns with their academic goals and how it helped them.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="font-italic">"I have been a part of the AIC since its commencement. When I made the decision of becoming a part of AIC, I didn't realize I was making a choice that would change my life forever. It not only helped me understand the basics of AI and ML but also presented various opportunities for me. My favorite bit of AIC apart from the free to learn setting and tailored feedback, I grew by great leaps and bounds with each session. And getting mentored by a student is just like icing on the cake."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="text-right"> - Bhrugu Dave, Lead of Python Fundamentals and Senior member of the AIC</p>

<br>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="font-italic">"From being on the other side of the stage, learning basics of ML and understanding the vast domain of AI, to taking the lead in one of the tracks ‘Research paper reading’, It has been a great experience being part of AIC from the founding day itself. Thanking Dishant for providing this opportunity on our campus."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="text-right"> - Meet Diwan, Lead of Research Paper Readings and Senior member of the AIC</p>

<br>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="font-italic">"Dishant explains complicated concepts by giving engaging examples that not only helped understanding things but also inspired me to explore more about that topic. Overall, He is a great teacher."</p>

  <p class="text-right"> - Shambhavi Aggarwal, Former member of the AIC</p>  
  
<br>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="font-italic">"AIC is very unconventional in its approach, and that is one of the best things about it. Through collaborative learning, knowledge is broken down in the most basic form, thus helping everyone understand it fully!"</p>
