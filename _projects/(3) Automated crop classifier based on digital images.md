description: This project was made under the guidance of Indian Space Research Organisation. We proposed an object detection model to work with normal digital images to automatically classify various crop fields. Here we propose a two step object detection model to classify, using SSD as detection model and Mobile Net as feature extractor.

# Automatic Crop-fields classifier trained on Digital Images

This project was developed under **RRSC(W), ISRO, Dept. of Space, Govt. of India**. The project was made in order to address the problem of remote sensing the crop fields using radar, in difficult weather. As the wether affects the quality of radar images, we used a digital photography approach to train a ML model to detect the crop fields as well as run stress test algorithms on it.

The project pipeline also contained the UAV development for the aerial photo imagery. However my team worked on the software part.
